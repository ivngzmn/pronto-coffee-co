## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Bootstrap CSS, JS, API, JSON, NODE.JS, EXPRESS, MONGODB, USER AUTH & Heroku

I wanted to be able to create a full stack web app that allowed a coffee shop to be able to have their own ordering application. I used Bootstrap for this project and it helped get the layout completed rapidly. With MongoDB Atlas it was nice and straightforward to set up and get things communicating with my developer build. As for deployment Heroku came in for the rescue.

Todo:
Update layout
Switch over to Tailwind CSS
Add Coffee Shop main page

## Lessons Learned:

Even though I liked using render, Heroku came into the rescue and the cli tools made it much easier to deploy this time around.
